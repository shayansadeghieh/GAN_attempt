Using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce augmented and synthetic data.
I hate not having enough data... what if i could generate some?

Tools: Tensorflow, Networkx and all the normal stuff like pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc.

The goal is to create a GAN for non-image data.

A GAN is made up of two entities, a generator and a discriminator. To best understand the difference, watch this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw9r8CL98N0&t=1054s
